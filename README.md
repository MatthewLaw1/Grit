### About Grit
Grit isn’t just about seeing inside the AI — it’s about using AI to sharpen human reasoning. It’s a platform that helps teachers and students trace, adapt, and expand on an AI’s chain of thought. Imagine GitHub, but for thinking: You can fork an idea, annotate each step, explore alternative approaches, and even map out where reasoning falters — not just to debug the AI, but to refine your own thinking.

<!-- ### Setup
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Install Next.js frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install Python backend dependencies
cd tree-of-thought-llm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
TOT_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Create a `.env` file in the tree-of-thought-llm directory:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Python Tree of Thought service:
```bash
cd tree-of-thought-llm
python api.py
```

2. In a new terminal, start the Next.js frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser -->

### Features
<!-- - Toggle between Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought reasoning
- Interactive visualization of reasoning steps
- Support for both OpenAI and Anthropic models
- Tree-based exploration of multiple reasoning paths
- Confidence scoring for each reasoning branch -->
- **Live Chain‑of‑Thought Visualization:** Streams token‑by‑token AI output into a dynamic, interactive graph.  
- **Branching Deep‑dives:** Click any reasoning step to open a side conversation—define terms, explore sub‑concepts, view code snippets or diagrams—then return to the main thread seamlessly.  
- **Multimodal Support:** Renders code blocks, LaTeX formulas, and inline diagrams in real time.  
- **Persistent Context:** Every branch remembers where it came from and reconnects smoothly to the parent chain once you’re ready.


### What's next for Grit
- **Product Launch:** Launch our Product as an Embedded Tool in Educate AI, with a user base of 700,000 educators across the globe.
- **Activation Extraction:** Integrate research‑grade techniques to surface latent activation patterns for an even deeper look under the hood.  
- **Mini‑Course Generator:** Auto‑compile a series of related reasoning flows into a custom study plan.  
- **Multi‑Model Support:** Let users pick from different reasoning styles (e.g., “concise,” “pedagogical,” “deep dive”) and compare outputs.  
- **Mobile & Collaborative Modes:** Dedicated iOS/Android apps and shared reasoning sessions so teams can workshop complex problems together.  
- **Learning Analytics:** Aggregate anonymized CoT paths to identify common stumbling blocks and recommend targeted resources.
